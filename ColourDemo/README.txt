Demonstration programs for the Colour Maximite:

COLOUR-1.BAS   Will draw random circles filled with colour

COLOUR-2.BAS   Will show how the MODE command can be used

MUSIC.BAS      Will play a sequence of music files
                    First it will copy the files to drive A:
                    Then it will play the first.  To play the next press space.

JULIA.BAS      This will plot the Julia set on the Colour Maximite.  
                    The Julia set is mathematically similar to the more famous 
                    Mandelbrot set and can generate some beautiful images.  Be
                    patient as it takes about 15 minutes to calculate.  For more
